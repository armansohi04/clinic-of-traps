# 🏥 Operation Escape 

A terminal-based C++ puzzle game set in a hospital overtaken by a killer doctor. Solve critical-thinking challenges in different rooms to rescue hostages before it’s too late.

## 🧠 How It Works
- 🧪 **Lab Puzzle** – Blood type compatibility
- 🚑 **ER Puzzle** – Triage prioritization
- 🕵️ **Morgue Puzzle** – Deduction based on conflicting clues

## 📁 Files
- `main.cpp` – Starts the game
- `Game.h` – Class and struct declarations
- `Game.cpp` – Core logic and puzzle implementations
- `hospital_game` – Mac executable (rename or rebuild if needed)

## 🛠️ To Compile & Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp Game.cpp -o hospital_game
./hospital_game
```
